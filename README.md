# iPhone Commerce DBMS

**Phase 1:** Created a problem statement with business-oriented data and functional requirements from Appleâ€™s perspective to a Database Administrator for data modeling and support through a database management system (DBMS)

**Phase 2:** Developed an Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram from the problem statement, mapped the EER to relational schemas and normalized the resulting relations to Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)

**Phase 3:** Transformed the relations into tables in a Relational database management system (RDBMS) by using DDL and DML

**Phase 4:** Constructed complex SQL ad-hoc queries to satisfy the business requirements presented in the problem statement

**Phase 5:** Developed a front-end application using Python that interfaces with the oracle DBMS at backend.
